# Contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to Neverest CLI!

As you may have already noticed, Neverest CLI does not use GitHub issues nor pull requests systems. *Why?* Because Neverest CLI supports open source, hence the choice behind [SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~soywod/neverest-cli). **You do not require an account on SourceHut to contribute**, you just need an email address, and it is dead simple. Here a short migration guide from GitHub to SourceHut:

## GitHub Discussions

The equivalent of GitHub Discussions is the **SourceHut mailing list**. You can consult existing messages at <https://lists.sr.ht/~soywod/pimalaya>. You can "open a new discussion" by sending an email at [~soywod/pimalaya@lists.sr.ht](mailto:~soywod/pimalaya@lists.sr.ht). You can also [subscribe](mailto:~soywod/pimalaya+subscribe@lists.sr.ht) and [unsubscribe](mailto:~soywod/pimalaya+unsubscribe@lists.sr.ht) to the mailing list, this way you receive a copy of all discussions.

You can also join the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) chat room [#pimalaya.neverest](https://matrix.to/#/#pimalaya.neverest:matrix.org).

## GitHub Issues

The equivalent of GitHub Issues is the **SourceHut bug tracker**. You can consult existing bugs at <https://todo.sr.ht/~soywod/pimalaya>, and you can "open a new issue" by sending an email at [~soywod/pimalaya@todo.sr.ht](mailto:~soywod/pimalaya@todo.sr.ht).

## GitHub Pull Requests

The equivalent of GitHub Pull requests is the **SourceHut mailing list** as well. You can "open a new pull request" by sending an email containing a git patch at [~soywod/pimalaya@lists.sr.ht](mailto:~soywod/pimalaya@lists.sr.ht). The simplest way to send a patch is to use [git send-email](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email), follow [this guide](https://git-send-email.io/) to configure git properly.
